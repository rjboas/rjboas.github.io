        <h3>Bubble Tea #2</h3>
        Because everything is funnier the second time.
        <blockquote>
            The tea: Honeydew Milk Tea with pearls 
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Refreshing flavour, but still with a nice milky texture.
            Less sugar is the way to go imo.
            Pearls work well, but I imagine other toppings would pair well too.
            <br>
            Overall: recommended (if you like honeydew)

        <h3>Bubble Tea #1</h3>
        An archive of a random "review" I sent to a group chat.
        <blockquote>
            The tea: Thick Coconut Brulee Milk Tea
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            The combination of fresh milk and coconut flavour is quite strange,
            but I found mixing in the brulee cream made it smoother tasting.
            The chocolate biscuit crumbs work well to contrast.
            Coconut jelly is generally pretty good.
            <br>
            Overall: not strongly recommended.
            You could probably just try coconut jelly in fresh milk or milk tea,
            or spend the reasonable amount of money on something you prefer better.
