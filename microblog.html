                Monster Mango Loco
                <blockquote>
                    Very flavoured, nice combination.
                    The strong sweetness makes sense for mango.
                    Overall quite nice, would rate it above the peach one I reckon.

                Monster Pipeline Punch
                <blockquote>
                    Kinda similar to Ultra Rosa but sugars are nicer than sweeteners in my opinion,
                    not as top tier as the mango one but close or tied, maybe.
                    Where the Mango Loco flavours meld together very well,
                    this feels more like the flavours are sitting together but still somewhat distinct.

                Monster Ultra Peachy Keen
                <blockquote>
                    Interesting flavour. Unsure if I like it or not.

                Monster Ultra Rosa
                <blockquote>
                    A bit metallic after a while, but I'm still quite fond of it.

                Monster Ultra Gold
                <blockquote>
                    Tastes like liquid gold gummy bear flavour. Pretty one-note but not bad.

                <blockquote>
                    Pretty tasty, but nothing too special.

                <blockquote>
                    I think I prefer the original flavour.

                Rockstar Tropical Guava
                <blockquote>
                    Pretty good.
                    Slightly less complex than Mango Loco or Pipeline Punch but quite tasty.
                    Reminds me of something that I can't quite remember at the moment.

        <h3>Bubble Tea Thoughts #3</h3>
        Taro Milk Tea
        <blockquote>
            Quality varies between stores,
            but usually a solid choice with pearls
            or red bean (nice flavour, but my impression of the texture in a beverage is more mixed).
            Definitely a "less sugar" milk tea.
            I'm personally a fan of thicker beverages so that works for me also.

        <h3>Bubble Tea Thoughts #2</h3>
        Honeydew Milk Tea with pearls
        <blockquote>
            Refreshing flavour, but still with a nice milky texture.
            Less sugar is the way to go imo.
            Pearls work well, but I imagine other toppings would pair well too.

        <h3>Bubble Tea Thoughts #1</h3>
        Thick Coconut Brulee Milk Tea
        <blockquote>
            The combination of fresh milk and coconut flavour is quite strange,
            but I found mixing in the brulee cream made it smoother tasting.
            The chocolate biscuit crumbs work well to contrast.
            Coconut jelly is generally pretty good.
